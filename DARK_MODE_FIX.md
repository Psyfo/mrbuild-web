# Dark Mode Issue - Fixed

## Problem

The `/login` and `/setup` pages were displaying with dark backgrounds, making them look incorrect.

## Root Cause

The auth pages had hardcoded dark gradient backgrounds in their JSX:

```tsx
className = 'bg-gradient-to-br from-gray-900 via-gray-800 to-gray-900';
```

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Dark Theme from CSS (`src/styles/globals.css`)

- ✅ Removed the `.dark` class selector with all dark mode color variables
- ✅ Kept only light theme variables in `:root`
- ✅ Added `color-scheme: light;` to body to prevent browser dark mode

### 2. Updated HTML Element (`src/app/layout.tsx`)

- ✅ Added `className='light'` to `<html>` element to explicitly set light mode

### 3. Fixed Auth Pages

- ✅ **Login page** (`src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`):
  - Changed from: `bg-gradient-to-br from-gray-900 via-gray-800 to-gray-900`
  - Changed to: `bg-gradient-to-br from-gray-50 via-gray-100 to-gray-50`
- ✅ **Setup page** (`src/app/(auth)/setup/page.tsx`):
  - Changed from: `bg-gradient-to-br from-gray-900 via-gray-800 to-gray-900`
  - Changed to: `bg-gradient-to-br from-gray-50 via-gray-100 to-gray-50`

## Result

- ✅ Both `/login` and `/setup` pages now display with light, clean backgrounds
- ✅ Text is readable and properly contrasted
- ✅ No dark mode will be applied anywhere in the application
- ✅ Consistent light theme across all pages

## Files Modified

1. `src/styles/globals.css` - Removed `.dark` selector
2. `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added light mode class
3. `src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` - Changed background gradient
4. `src/app/(auth)/setup/page.tsx` - Changed background gradient

## Testing

Navigate to:

- http://localhost:3000/login - Should show light gray gradient background
- http://localhost:3000/setup - Should show light gray gradient background

Both pages should be bright and readable with proper contrast.
