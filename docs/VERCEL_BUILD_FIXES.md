# Vercel Build Fixes

## Issues Encountered & Solutions

### Issue 1: `useSearchParams()` Missing Suspense Boundary

**Error:**

```
⨯ useSearchParams() should be wrapped in a suspense boundary at page "/login"
Error occurred prerendering page "/login"
```

**Cause:**
Next.js 14 requires components using `useSearchParams()` to be wrapped in a `<Suspense>` boundary for static generation during build time.

**Solution:**
Refactored the login page to separate the form component and wrap it in Suspense:

```tsx
// src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx
function LoginForm() {
  const searchParams = useSearchParams(); // Now wrapped in Suspense
  // ... rest of login logic
}

export default function LoginPage() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>
      <LoginForm />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

**Status:** ✅ Fixed

### Issue 2: Failed to Collect Page Data for API Routes

**Error:**

```
Error: Failed to collect page data for /api/admin/setup
    at /vercel/path0/node_modules/next/dist/build/utils.js:1269:15
```

**Cause:**
Next.js was attempting to statically generate API routes, which should always be dynamic. The build process was trying to collect page data for API endpoints that need to be server-side only.

**Solution:**
Added dynamic runtime configuration to all API route handlers:

```typescript
// Added to each API route
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';
export const runtime = 'nodejs';
```

**Files Updated:**

1. `src/app/api/admin/setup/route.ts`
2. `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`
3. `src/app/api/contact/route.ts`

**Status:** ✅ Fixed

## Build Results

### Successful Build Output

```
✓ Compiled successfully
✓ Linting and checking validity of types
✓ Collecting page data
✓ Generating static pages (9/9)
✓ Collecting build traces
✓ Finalizing page optimization
```

### Route Map

```
Route (app)                              Size     First Load JS
┌ ○ /                                    36.4 kB         168 kB

○  (Static)   - prerendered as static content
ƒ  (Dynamic)  - server-rendered on demand
```

**Note:** All API routes now correctly show as `ƒ (Dynamic)` - server-rendered on demand.

## Key Changes Summary

### 1. Login Page (src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx)

- Extracted form logic into `LoginForm` component
- Wrapped `LoginForm` in `<Suspense>` boundary
- Added loading fallback UI
- Maintains full functionality with callback URL support

### 2. API Routes Configuration

- Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to prevent static generation
- Added `export const runtime = 'nodejs'` for server-side execution
- Applied to:
  - Admin setup route
  - NextAuth API route
  - Contact form route

---

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Local build passes (`npm run build`)
- [x] All pages compile successfully
- [x] API routes marked as dynamic
- [x] Login page renders with Suspense
- [x] No TypeScript errors
- [x] Sitemap generates correctly
- [x] Ready for Vercel deployment

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. ✅ Commit these changes
2. ✅ Push to GitHub
3. ✅ Vercel will auto-deploy
4. ✅ Monitor Vercel build logs for success

---

## Environment Variables Required on Vercel

Ensure these are set in Vercel project settings:

```env
# MongoDB
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://...

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.com
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-production-secret

# Admin Setup
ADMIN_SETUP_SECRET=your-setup-secret

# Email (Zoho)
MAIL_HOST=smtppro.zoho.com
MAIL_PORT=465
MAIL_USER=your-email@domain.com
MAIL_PASS=your-password
MAIL_TO=recipient@domain.com

# Node Environment
NODE_ENV=production
```

---

## Production Deployment Notes

### Security

- Generate new `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` for production (use: `openssl rand -base64 32`)
- Generate new `ADMIN_SETUP_SECRET` for production
- Never commit `.env.local` to repository

### Performance

- All static pages are pre-rendered
- API routes are dynamic (as required)
- First Load JS optimized (~87.7 kB shared)

### Monitoring

- Check Vercel deployment logs
- Test admin login functionality
- Verify contact form works
- Test branch locator map

---

## Troubleshooting

### If build fails on Vercel:

1. Check environment variables are set correctly
2. Ensure `MONGODB_URI` is accessible from Vercel IPs
3. Verify `NEXTAUTH_URL` matches your domain
4. Check Vercel function logs for runtime errors

### If API routes don't work:

1. Verify dynamic export is present in route files
2. Check environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. Test MongoDB connection from Vercel IP range
4. Review function logs in Vercel dashboard
